# Complexity

> "Science must, over the next 50 years, learn to deal with these problems of organized complexity."
> -- Warren Weaver, 1948

> Human beings, viewed as behaving systems, are quite simple. The apparent complexity of our behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment in which we find ourselves.
> -â€” Herbert A. Simon (1916 - 2001)
